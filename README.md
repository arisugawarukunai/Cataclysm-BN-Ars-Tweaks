# How to use this repository

This repository will contain everything from small tweak mods, to changes I'm working on, and even bigger mods and projects in the future.

*Cauntion is advised when using anything inside Ars Dev.*

For a smoother experience, add the mods here to your /userdata/mods folder, rather than /data/mods.

## Ars Dev

Anything in this "mod" is a feature I am working on to be potentially merged into the base game. Everything here is experimental and will likely change.

It's unwise to have this mod active on your main save, and it should really only be for testing purposes.

### JSON and Lua files

For JSON and Lua, this works like a normal mod, and can be added to a world through the in-game mod UI.

### .cpp files (only if compiling game yourself)

Anything added to the /src folder are .cpp files that **NOT** would be automatically loaded in. However, you ***CAN*** replace the files here with the ones in the /src folder, inside your repository clone.

Warning that, while I don't push code that doesn't work, these changes are wildly unstable, may contain errors, and should be merged in your code with care. It is unwise to use this with your primary save.

## Ars Tweaks

Completely unbalanced changes that I have made for my own personal playthroughs.
